# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my journey through the fascinating world of data structures and algorithms! This repository serves as a collection of my implementations, notes, and practice problems as I delve deeper into this essential field of computer science.

**Key Topics:**

* Arrays
* Stacks
* Linked Lists
* Recurssions
* Queues
* Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs,AVL etc.)
* Graphs
* Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort,etc.)
* Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search.etc.)
 ... and more!


**Why Data Structures and Algorithms?**

They are the building blocks of efficient and optimized software. Understanding them is crucial for any programmer who wants to:

* Write cleaner and more maintainable code.
* Solve complex problems effectively.
* Improve the performance of their applications.
* Ace technical interviews!

**What You'll Find Here:**

* **Implementations:** Code examples of various data structures and algorithms in [programming languages used].
* **Notes:** Explanations and insights into the concepts behind each data structure and algorithm.
* **Practice Problems:** Solutions to coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.
